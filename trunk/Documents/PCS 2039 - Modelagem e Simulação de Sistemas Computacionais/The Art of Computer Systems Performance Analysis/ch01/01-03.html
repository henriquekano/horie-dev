<P>This example illustrates a technique known as the <B>ratio game</B>, which is discussed later in Chapter 11. Similar games can be played in selecting the workload, measuring the systems, and presenting the results. Some games are intentional, because the proponents of a system want to show the superiority of their proposed alternatives; others are simply a result of a lack of knowledge about performance evaluation techniques. A knowledge of common mistakes and games helps in understanding the importance of proper methodology. Therefore, such mistakes and games are discussed in many parts of this book.</P>

<P>For those new to the field of performance evaluation, there are a number of ways to keep abreast of the new developments in this field. Some of the journals, professional organizations, conferences, and other subjects that a performance analyst would find useful are the topics of this section.
</P>
<P>Computer systems performance analysts generally belong to at least two different types of professional organizations&#151;one dealing with performance and the other dealing with the type of computer systems that interest them. For example, a performance analyst working on database system would belong to database organizations and performance organizations. Some of the organizations devoted exclusively to performance analysis are as follows:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>ACM SIGMETRICS</I>: The Association for Computing Machinery&#146;s Special Interest Group concerned with computer system performance is an organization for researchers engaged in developing methodologies and users seeking new or improved techniques for analysis of computer systems. It publishes a newsletter, <I>Performance Evaluation Review</I>, which is distributed quarterly to all members. For membership and other information contact ACM, 11 West 42nd Street, New York, NY 10036.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>IEEE Computer Society</I>: The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society has a number of technical committees. In particular, the technical committee on simulation may be of interest to performance analysts. For further information contact IEEE, 345 47th Street, New York, NY 10017-2394.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>ACM SIGSIM</I>: The ACM&#146;s special interest group on simulation publishes <I>Simulation Digest</I>, a quarterly newsletter in cooperation with IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Simulation.
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>CMG</I>: The Computer Measurement Group, Inc. is oriented toward practical (as contrasted with theoretical) uses of computer performance measurement and evaluation tools and techniques. It publishes a quarterly journal called <I>CMG Transactions</I>, which contains articles on measurement, analysis, prediction, and management of computer systems performance. CMG has a number of regional groups in the United States and abroad that meet frequently to exchange information. The international regional groups include those in Australia, Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, Belgium, West Germany, France, and Italy. CMG headquarters are located at 111 E. Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL 60601.
<DD><B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>IFIP Working Group 7.3</I>: The International Federation for Information Processing is a multinational federation of technical societies concerned with information processing. The American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS) represents the United States. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the IEEE, and other professional organizations are members of AFIPS. IFIP has several technical committees (TCs) and working groups (WGs). The WG 7.3 is devoted to computer systems modeling.
<DD><B>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Society for Computer Simulation</I>: This is a society of professionals interested in computer simulation and mathematical modeling. The society sponsors regional meetings and national and international conferences and publishes a monthly technical journal, <I>Simulation</I>; the semiannual Simulation Series of hardbound books; and a quarterly journal, <I>Transactions of the Society for Computer Simulation.</I> The society has regional councils active in the continental United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. SCS sponsors the Summer Computer Simulation Conference, the SCS Multiconference, the Eastern Simulation Conferences, the Winter Simulation Conference, and others. For membership information write to The Society for Computer Simulation, P.O. Box 17900, San Diego, CA 92117. Similar societies exist in many other countries, for example, Dutch Benelux Simulation Society, Gesellschaft fur Informatic&#151;Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Simulation, Japan Society for Simulation Technology, The Italian Society for Computer Simulation, Chinese System Simulation Council, and The International Marine Simulator Forum.
<DD><B>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>SIAM</I>: The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics promotes basic research leading to the development of new mathematical techniques useful to industry and science. It publishes a number of journals on topics of interest to computer systems performance analysts. These include <I>SIAM Review, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, SIAM Journal on Computing, SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing</I>, and <I>Theory of Probability and Its Applications.</I> For further information contact SIAM, Suite 1400, 117 South 17th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103-5052.
<DD><B>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>ORSA</I>: The Operations Research Society of America is an organization of professionals interested in operation research techniques including linear and dynamic programming, queueing theory, game theory, network analysis, replacement and inventory theories, scheduling, and simulation. The society holds semiannual national meetings jointly with The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS). The society has a number of geographical sections, technical sections, special interest groups, and student sections throughout the United States. The society represents the United States in the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (INFORS). It publishes a number of journals of interest to performance analysts, including <I>Operations Research, ORSA Journal on Computing, Mathematics of Operations Research</I> (jointly with TIMS), <I>Operations Research Letters</I> (copublished with Elsevier/North-Holland), and <I>Stochastic Models</I> (copublished with Marcel Dekker). For further information contact ORSA Business Office, Mount Royal &amp Guilford Avenues, Baltimore, MD 21202.

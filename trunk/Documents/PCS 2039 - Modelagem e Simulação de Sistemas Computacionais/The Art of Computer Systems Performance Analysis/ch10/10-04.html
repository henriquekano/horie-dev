<P>The third level is divided into eight parts marked <IMG SRC="images/10-10i.jpg"></IMGI> These parts represent <IMG SRC="images/10-11i.jpg"></IMGI> <IMG SRC="images/10-12i.jpg"></IMGI> respectively. For each division, the two corresponding entries in the table are added to determine the length of the divisions. Dotted vertical lines are drawn to divide the next level also into eight parts.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/10-13i.jpg"></IMGI><IMG SRC="images/10-14i.jpg"></IMGI> The single entry corresponding to each of these combinations is used to determine the length of the division. At this point, you can cross check that the lengths of divisions at level C correspond to the sum of its two subdivisions at level D. Similarly, lengths at level B and A can be verified.</P>
<P>Now the final chart is drawn with all segments drawn to scale. The segments corresponding to a &#147;1&#148; value, that is, <I>A</I> = 1, <I>B</I> = 1, <I>C</I> = 1, or <I>D</I> = 1, are drawn with solid lines. The final Gantt chart for this example is shown in Figure 10.16. Notice that the marking at each level is such that the number of line segments is minimized.</P>

<P>A Kiviat graph is a visual device that helps system managers quickly recognize performance problems. It is a circular graph in which several different performance metrics are plotted along radial lines. In the most popular version of the graph, an even number of metrics are used. Half of these metrics are HB metrics (see Section 3.4) so that a higher value of the metric is considered better. The other half of the metrics measure are LB metrics, and a lower value is considered better. For example, CPU utilization is an HB metric because a higher utilization implies that the resource is being used. The percentage of time the CPU is waiting for I/O completion (CPU in a wait state) is an LB metric, and it would be better to have as little wait state time as possible. The HB and LB metrics are plotted along alternate radial lines in a Kiviat graph. In an ideal system, all HB metrics should be high and all LB metrics should be low. In other words, the Kiviat graph for an ideal system is a star. The following example illustrates the ideas discussed so far.
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>Example 10.2</B> Consider the Kiviat graph shown in Figure 10.17. Eight different metrics are plotted along eight radial lines. The metrics as shown represent the percentage of time spent in the following eight states:
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU busy
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU only busy
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU and channel overlap
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel only busy
<DD><B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any channel busy
<DD><B>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU wait
<DD><B>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU in problem state
<DD><B>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU in supervisor state
</DL>
<DD>The first metric, percentage of time CPU is busy, or CPU utilization, is an HB metric in the sense that the resource is being used and not wasted. It would be preferable to have as many resources simultaneously busy as possible so that there is a high parallelism in the resource usage. The second metric, percentage of time CPU only is busy, measures the fraction of time when only the CPU is used and none of the I/O channels are used. This is an LB metric since a low value of this metric is preferable. The third metric, CPU and channel overlap, measures the percentage of time the CPU is busy along with at least one I/O channel. It is preferable to have this value high and so this is an HB metric. The fourth metric, channel only busy, measures the time when the channel is being used but the CPU is idle. The CPU may be waiting for the I/O. This is again an LB metric. The fifth metric, any channel busy, is an HB metric since a high value would indicate the resource being put to use. The next three metrics measure the percentage of time CPU is in three different states as indicated by the processor status register. The CPU in the wait state indicates that it is waiting for I/O completion and represents wasted resource. The CPU in the problem state indicates the time used executing the user&#146;s program. A high value of this is considered good. Finally, the CPU in the supervisor state indicates the time spent in operating the system code. This represents the operating system overhead and is considered bad.

<DD>Notice that the good and the bad metrics alternate. All metrics in this example lie between 0 and 100%. The minimum value 0% is plotted as a point at the center of the circle, and the maximum value 100% is plotted along the periphery of the circle. The ideal desired graph is a star with all good metrics being at 100% and all bad metrics at 0%.
<DD>Figure 10.18 shows a Kiviat graph for a balanced well-utilized system. The CPU and I/O utilizations are both 95%, and the overlap is 90%. Most of the CPU time is spent in the problem state.
<DD>Although the set of metrics used in this example was one of the most popular sets in the early 1970s when the Kiviat graphs were first introduced and almost all existing literature on Kiviat graphs uses these metrics for illustration, these metrics may not be good for all systems. One problem with this set is that the metrics are interrelated. There are only four independent metrics. Others can be obtained by the following relationships:

<P>The main reason for the popularity of Kiviat graphs over the popular Gantt chart form was the easy recognition of patterns by the system managers. In the 1970s, when the Kiviat graphs were first introduced, a number of commonly occurring shapes were given interesting names such as CPU keelboat, I/O arrow, and so forth. Figures 10.19 to 10.21 show these popular patterns. Figure 10.19 shows a CPU-bound system that has a high CPU utilization with very little I/O usage. The Kiviat graph for this system looks similar to a keelboat, and hence the pattern was dubbed CPU keelboat. Figure 10.20 shows an I/O-bound system with high I/O utilization and low CPU usage. Due to the wedge shape of the graph, it is called I/O wedge. Finally, Figure 10.21 shows the so-called I/O arrow and represents a system that uses considerable I/O as well as CPU.
</P>
<P>Given two Kiviat graphs, it is easy to tell which system is more balanced by looking at their shapes. However, if a quantitative measure of the goodness of a graph can be designed, it will not be necessary to plot it. A number of such <I>figures of merit</I> have been proposed. The most popular one is due to Merrill (1974, 1975). He proposed that the LB axes be reversed so that 0% is plotted along the circumference while 100% is plotted at the center; the square root of the area of this reversed Kiviat graph could be used to compare the overall goodness of systems. Consider a Kiviat graph with 2n axes. Let the percentage of performance values for a system be {<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUB>, . . .,<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2<I>n</I></SMALL></SUB>}, where the odd values <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>,<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUB>, . . .,<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2<I>n</I>&#150;1</SMALL></SUB> represent good metrics and the even values <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>,<I>X</I><SUB><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUB>, . . .,<I>X</I><SUB><SMALL>2<I>n</I></SMALL></SUB> represent bad metrics. All <I>x<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB></I>&#146;<B>s</B> are percentages and lie between 0 and 100. Merrill&#146;s <B>Figure Of Merit (FOM)</B> is computed as follows:</P>

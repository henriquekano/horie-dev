</BLOCKQUOTE><P>One of the important steps in every performance evaluation study is the presentation of final results. The eventual aim of every performance analysis is to help in decision making. An analysis whose results cannot be understood by the decision makers is as good as one that was never performed. It is the responsibility of the analyst to ensure that results of the analysis are conveyed to the decision makers as clearly and simply as possible. This requires prudent use of words, pictures, and graphs to explain the results and the analysis.
</P>
<P>Graphic charts such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and histograms are commonly used in presenting performance results. Guidelines for preparing such graphic charts are briefly discussed. In addition, a number of graphic charts that have been developed specifically for computer systems performance analysis are described. These are Gantt charts, Kiviat graphs, and Schumacher charts.</P>
<P>There are a number of reasons why a graphic chart may be used for data presentation in place of a textual explanation. First of all, a picture is worth a thousand words. A graphic chart saves readers&#146; time and present the same information more concisely. It can also be used to interest the reader. Most readers find it easier to look at the figures to quickly grasp the main points of the study and read the text only for details. A graphic chart is also a good way to emphasize or clarify a point, to reinforce a conclusion, and to summarize the results of a study.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">10.1 TYPES OF VARIABLES</FONT></H3>
<P>One important factor that affects the choice of a graphic chart is the type of variable to be displayed. Variables are of two types: quantitative and qualitative. <B>Qualitative variables</B>, also called <B>categorical variables</B>, have states, levels, or categories that are defined by a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive subclasses. The subclasses, which are usually expressed in words, can be <I>ordered</I> or <I>unordered</I>. For instance, a computer type with three subclasses&#151;supercomputers, minicomputers, and microcomputers&#151;is an ordered qualitative variable. The variable workload type with three subclasses&#151;scientific workload, engineering workload, and educational workload&#151;is an unordered qualitative variable.</P>
<P><B>Quantitative variables</B> are those whose levels are expressed numerically. There are two types of quantitative variables: discrete and continuous. For discrete variables, all values of the variable can be counted and put into a one-to-one correspondence with some subset or all of the set of positive integers. The number of values can be finite or infinite, but in either case the number is countable. Number of processors in a multiprocessor system, size of disks in blocks, number of peripherals in a system, are all examples of discrete quantitative variables.</P>
<P>Continuous variables can take uncountably infinite values. In many computer programming languages, they are called <I>real</I> variables. The response time of a job on a system, the weight of a portable computer, and the footprint (base area) of a workstation are all examples of continuous quantitative variables.</P>
<P>The hierarchy of various types of variables is summarized in Figure 10.1. Knowing the type of variable is important, since the type of graphic chart to be used depends upon the type of variable. A line chart is used to show the relationship between two continuous variables. A column chart or bar chart is used when the independent variable (also called <I>x</I>-variable) is a discrete or a qualitative variable.</P>

<P>The following guidelines will help you enhance your graphical presentations. Only the guidelines that apply to a large number of cases are discussed; application of these techniques to individual cases is an art which you will learn with experience. Remember, all of the following are guidelines, not rules.
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Require Minimum Effort from the Reader</I>: The single most important metric to measure the goodness of a graphic chart is the level of effort required to read and understand the chart, that is, to get the message. Given two representations of the same data, one can easily distinguish which one requires less effort, which is the preferable one.
<BR>For example, consider the issue of deciding whether to use a legend box in a chart. There are two common ways of identifying different curves in a line chart: legends and direct labeling. Each curve corresponds to a different alternative and may be represented by a different line pattern. A <I>legend box</I>, as shown in Figure 10.2b, may be used to specify the correspondence between the patterns and the alternatives. This requires a little more effort on the part of reader than direct labeling of the curves, as shown in Figure 10.2a. Therefore, direct labeling is preferable particularly if the number of curves is large. Similarly, in a column chart, direct labeling of each column is preferable to a separate legend box.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maximize Information</I>: There should be sufficient information on the graph to make it self-sufficient. There are a number of ways to achieve this. Use key words in place of symbols since the symbols require extra access to the reader&#146;s memory to make sense. The axes labels should be as informative as possible. For example, if you are plotting daily CPU usage, &#147;Daily CPU usage&#148; is preferred over &#147;CPU usage.&#148; Include units in the labels: &#147;CPU time in seconds&#148; is more informative than &#147;CPU time.&#148;
<P><A NAME="Fig2"></A><A HREF="javascript:displayWindow('images/10-02.jpg',500,216 )"><IMG SRC="images/10-02t.jpg"></A>
<BR><A HREF="javascript:displayWindow('images/10-02.jpg',500,216)"><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>FIGURE 10.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct labeling of curves in (a) is preferable to a legend box in (b).</P>
<P><A NAME="Fig3"></A><A HREF="javascript:displayWindow('images/10-03.jpg',500,202 )"><IMG SRC="images/10-03t.jpg"></A>
<BR><A HREF="javascript:displayWindow('images/10-03.jpg',500,202)"><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>FIGURE 10.3</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two graphs from the same data. The second graph is more informative.</P>
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Minimize Ink</I>: Present as much information as possible with as little ink as possible. The goal should be to maximize the information-to-ink ratio. Too much unnecessary information on a chart makes it cluttered and uninteresting. For example, grid lines on a graph should not be shown unless they are required to accurately read the values. Also, the chart that gives more information for the same data is preferable. For example, consider the two bar line charts in Figures 10.3a and 10.3b that show the availability and unavailability of a system. The unavailability is simply 1 minus the availability, but the second graph is more meaningful and informative than the first one.
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Use Commonly Accepted Practices</I>: Present what people expect. Most people expect the origin to be (0,0), the independent variable or <I>cause</I> to be plotted along the <I>x</I>-axis, the dependent variable or <I>effect</I> to be plotted along the <I>y</I>-axis, scales to be linear, scales to increase left to right and bottom to top, and all scale divisions to be equal. Departures from these practices are permitted but require extra effort from the reader and should be used only when necessary.
<DD><B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Avoid Ambiguity</I>: Show coordinate axes, scale divisions, and origin. Identify individual curves and bars. The graph should be easy to read. Do not plot multiple variables in the same chart.
</DL>
<P>The preceding list includes only a few of the possible guidelines. Box 10.1 presents a checklist to make it easier for you to check each of your graphs. The checklist is arranged so that a &#147;yes&#148; answer to each question, in general, leads to a better graph. However, in some cases an analyst may consciously decide not to follow a suggestion if it helps in conveying the intended message.

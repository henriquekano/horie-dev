<P>The correlation is in fact high. This may be due to large programs (programs with large memory sizes) doing more I/O&#146;s than small programs. Th get a meaningful regression, we could try eliminating one of the two variables. In Example 14.1, we have already regressed CPU time on number of disk I/O&#146;s and found that the regression parameter was significant. Similarly, in Exercise 14.3, CPU time is regressed on the memory size, and the resulting regression parameters are found to be significant. Thus, either the number of I/O&#146;s or the memory size can be used to estimate CPU time, but not both.
</P>
<P>One important lesson to learn here is that adding a predictor variable does not always improve a regression. If the variable is correlated to other predictor variables, it may reduce the statistical accuracy of the regression.</P>
<P>If an analyst wants to choose the right subset of predictors from a set of <I>k</I> possible predictors, the simplest alternative is to try all 2<SUP><SMALL><I>k</I></SMALL></SUP> possible subsets and choose the one that gives the best results with a small number of variables. Several different trade-offs may have to be made in selecting the subset. For example, some variables may be easier to measure and are better suited as predictors than others. With increasing availability of computing power, trying all 2<SUP><SMALL><I>k</I></SMALL></SUP> subsets is usually not a problem for reasonable values of <I>k</I> and sample sizes. In any case, a correlation matrix for the subset chosen should be computed and checked to see that the correlation among the chosen predictors is low.</P>

<P>Regression can also be used in one or more of the predictor variables as categorical variables&#151;variables that are nonnumerical. For example, CPU type is a categorical variable. If you have performance data on three CPUs of types A, B, and C, you can use regression to model the data as discussed in this section.
</P>
<P><I>Note</I>: If all predictor variables are categorical, you should use one of the experimental design and analysis techniques described in Part IV of this book. Although the technique presented in this section can be used for several categorical predictors as well, statistically more precise (less variant) results will be obtained using factorial designs described in Part IV. Therefore, the use of the technique described in this section should be limited to the case of mixed predictors where most predictors are quantitative and only a few predictors are categorical.</P>
<P>To represent a categorical variable that can take only two values, we can define a binary variable, for instance, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL><I>j</I></SMALL></SUB>, as follows. The advantage of this coding is that the regression parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL><I>j</I></SMALL></SUB> represents the difference in the effect of the two alternatives. If the parameter is found to be statistically insignificant, the two alternatives can be assumed to provide similar performance.</P>
<P>The levels of the binary variable can also be &#150;1 and &#43;1. Thus,</P>
<P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/15-17d.jpg"></P>
</IMGD></P>
<P>The parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL><I>j</I></SMALL></SUB> in this case represents the difference from the average response for each level. The difference of the effects of the two levels is 2<I>b</I><SUB><SMALL><I>j</I></SMALL></SUB>.</P>
<P>If the categorical variable takes three values, for instance, A, B, and C, the coding is not obvious. One alternative, which is undesirable, is to define a three-valued variable as follows:</P>
<P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/15-18d.jpg"></P>
</IMGD></P>
<P>The problem with this coding is that it implies an order. It attempts to represent B halfway between A and C. In general, this is not true. The regression parameters, in this case, do not provide any meaningful information. The recommended coding is to use two predictor variables, for instance, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>, and <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>, defined as follows:</P>
<P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/15-19d.jpg"></P>
</IMGD></P>
<P>Thus, the three types are represented by (<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>) pairs as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>) = (1, 0) &#8658; type A</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>) = (0, 1) &#8658; type B</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(<I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>) = (0, 0) &#8658; type C</P>
<P>The coding does not imply any ordering among the types. Also, it provides an easy way to interpret the regression parameters. Suppose the regression model with this coding is</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>y</I> = <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUB> &#43; <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB><I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> &#43;<I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB><I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> &#43; <I>e</I></P>
<P>The average responses for the three types are</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/15-20d.jpg"></P>
</IMGD></P>
<P>Thus, the parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> represents the difference between average responses with types A and C. The parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> represents the difference between average responses with types B and C. The parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUB> represents average response with type C.</P>
<P>In general, the number of values that a categorical variable can take is called its <B>level</B>. Thus, to represent a categorical variable with <I>k</I> levels (or <I>k</I> categories), we need to define <I>k</I> &#150; 1 binary variables as follows:</P>
<P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/15-21d.jpg"></P>
</IMGD></P>
<P>The <I>k</I>th value is defined by <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> = <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> ... = <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>k&#150;1</SMALL></SUB> = 0. The regression parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUB> represents the average response with the <I>k</I>th alternative. The parameter <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL><I>j</I></SMALL></SUB> represents the difference between the average responses with alternatives <I>j</I> and <I>k</I>.</P>
<P>Given <I>k</I> alternatives, if one of the alternatives represents the status quo or a standard against which other alternatives have to be measured, that alternative should be coded as the <I>k</I>th alternative since the differences from the <I>k</I>th response are directly available as regression parameters.</P>

<DD><B>Case Study 15.1</B> Let us reconsider the RPC performance data of Case Study 14.1. One possible model for the data is to combine the samples on the two operating systems and use the following model:
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>y</I> = <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUB> &#43; <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB><I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> &#43; <I>b</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB><I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>
<DD>where <I>y</I> is the elapsed time, <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> is the data size, and <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> is a binary variable representing UNIX or ARGUS as follows:
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/15-22d.jpg"></P>
</IMGD>
<DD>The computed parameter values and their confidence intervals are shown in Table 15.5. All three parameters are significant. The regression explains 76.5% of the variation.
<DD>The model parameters are interpreted as follows. The per-byte processing cost (time) for both operating systems is 0.025 millisecond; the setup cost is 36.73 milliseconds on ARGUS, which is 14.927 milliseconds more than that with UNIX.
<DD>As an aside, notice that this model and its conclusions are different from those of the model used in Case Study 14.1 earlier. There we had concluded that there was no significant difference in the setup cost of the two operating systems. The per-byte costs were different. Which conclusion is correct? This is where system considerations help, and this is why statistical techniques applied without understanding the system can lead to a misleading result.
<DD>The model of Case Study 14.1 was based on the assumption that the processing as well as setup in the two operating systems are different. They were both modeled as separate parameters. Thus, there were four parameters in all. The data showed that the setup costs were numerically indistinguishable.

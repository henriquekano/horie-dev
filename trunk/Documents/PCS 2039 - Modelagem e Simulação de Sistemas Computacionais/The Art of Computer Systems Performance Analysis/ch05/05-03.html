<P>In analytical modeling, the resource demands placed by the requests, rather than the requests themselves, are used as the workload. For example, the statement that each user has an average CPU time of 50 milliseconds and makes 20 I/O&#146;s per request may be a sufficient workload description for analytical modeling. In case of multiple services, several similar services can be grouped into a class, and each class may be characterized by its average resource demands.
</P>
<P>The average demand may not be sufficient in some cases, and it may be necessary to specify the complete probability distribution for resource demands. This is particularly the case if there is a large variance in resource demands or if the distribution is different than that used in the model. Particularly, in simulations, it is easy to use different distributions. The analytical models are generally restricted to a given distribution.</P>
<P>The workload descriptions used for analytical and simulation modeling are also referred to as <B>nonexecutable</B> workloads since they are not in a form suitable for execution on a real system. On the other hand, a trace of user commands that can be executed directly on a system would be called an <B>executable</B> workload.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">5.3 REPRESENTATIVENESS</FONT></H3>
<P>A test workload should be representative of the real application. One definition of representativeness is that the test workload and the real application match in the following three respects:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Arrival Rate:</I> The arrival rate of requests should be the same or proportional to that of the application.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Resource Demands:</I> The total demands on each of the key resources should be the same or proportional to that of the application.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Resource Usage Profile:</I> Resource usage profile relates to the sequence and the amounts in which different resources are used in an application. In a multiprogramming environment, it is important that the test workloads have a resource usage profile similar to that of the applications. Otherwise, it is possible that total resource demands of individual workloads may be representative of their respective applications, but when several workloads are run together, they may not produce results representative of combined applications.
</DL>
<H3><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">5.4 TIMELINESS</FONT></H3>
<P>Workloads should follow the changes in usage pattern in a timely fashion. User behavior has changed considerably over the years. For example, the trend has been to move away from machine languages toward higher level languages and from batch toward timesharing. Users change their usage pattern depending upon the services provided by the new systems. Thus, workloads become obsolete as soon as they become well understood. Nonetheless, these obsolete workloads keep getting used. The debit-credit workload used in transaction processing is an example of an outdated, but popular, workload. It is important that the workload represent the latest usage pattern.
</P>
<P>Timeliness is a difficult goal to achieve. The main problem is that real user behavior is a moving and fuzzy target. Any observed user behavior applies to a specific environment for a specific system at a specific time. Users change their behavior with time, and any change in system performance prompts users to change their usage behavior. Users tend to change their demands to optimize the response for a given system, focusing on those features that the system can perform efficiently. For example, the processors that provide fast multiplication have a much higher frequency of multiplication instructions than the processors with slow multiplication instructions. Even on the same system, the usage pattern changes with time. Initially, computers were primarily used for scientific applications that required fast arithmetic operations. Today, some may argue that applications such as databases are I/O intensive, so the speed of I/O is more important than the speed of arithmetic operations.</P>
<P>This interdependence of system design and workload provides opportunity for debate at every performance evaluation presentation. This is particularly true for the evaluation of systems under design. A workload based on an existing system, even if modified for the new system features, cannot be guaranteed to be an accurate representation of future workloads. Furthermore, designs that are optimized on the basis of one or more workloads cannot be guaranteed to operate efficiently in other environments. It is therefore very important that the user&#146;s behavior be monitored on an ongoing basis and that the workload be based on recent measurements from a similar system.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">5.5 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN WORKLOAD SELECTION</FONT></H3>
<P>There are a few more issues, in addition to the services exercised and the level of detail, to consider in workload selection. These issues&#151;loading level, impact of external components, and repeatability&#151;are explained next.
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loading Level:</I> A workload may exercise a system to its full capacity (best case), beyond its capacity (worst case), or at the load level observed in real workload (typical case). For procurement purposes, a workload measured in a similar existing environment may be good enough. However, for computer system design, you may have to identify all the environments where the system might be used and study performance under best, worst, and typical workloads. The correct choice of the loading level varies from case to case. For example, to measure the effectiveness of a congestion control scheme, the network should be exercised beyond its capacity, while the packet retransmission schemes should be tested for normal as well as heavy load, since the retransmissions may be required under both circumstances.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Impact of External Components:</I> Sometimes components outside the system may have a significant impact on the system&#146;s performance. For example, the completion time of a synthetic program may depend heavily on I/O device performance. This is not a good workload to compare two processors. The speed difference between the processors may be masked completely by the I/O device. Ignoring this issue often leads to the conclusion that all alternatives in the system give equally good performance. The reason may be that the workload does not exercise the system or that there is a component external to the system that is the bottleneck. Therefore, either the workload should be modified to put less load on this other component, the system configuration should be modified to make this external component less significant, or the results should be analyzed to predict the performance of the system in the absence of the external bottleneck.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Repeatability:</I> A workload should be such that the results can be easily reproduced without too much variance. Workloads that make a highly random demand on resources are less desirable since one would need to make many more runs to get a meaningful estimate of performance.
</DL>
<H3><A NAME="Heading7"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">EXERCISES</FONT></H3>
<DL>
<DD><B>5.1</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Decide the metric and workload you would choose to compare the following:
<DL>
<DD><B>a.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two systems for very different applications: IBM PC versus Macintosh
<DD><B>b.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two systems with identical functionality: IBM PC versus PCjr
<DD><B>c.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two versions of the same operating systems: MS-DOS V1 versus MSDOS V2
<DD><B>d.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hardware components: two floppy drives
<DD><B>e.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two languages: C versus Pascal
</DL>
<DD><B>5.2</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select an area of computer systems, for example, databases, networks, and processors. Prepare a table identifying increasing levels of services, components, factors, and workloads.

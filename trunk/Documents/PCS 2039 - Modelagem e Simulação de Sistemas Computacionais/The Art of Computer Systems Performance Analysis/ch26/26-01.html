<P>One of the key steps in developing a simulation is to have a routine to generate random values for variables with a specified random distribution, for example, exponential and normal. This is done in two steps. First, a sequence of random numbers distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 is obtained. Then the sequence is transformed to produce random values satisfying the desired distribution. The first step is called random-<I>number</I> generation and the second random-<I>variate</I> generation. We discuss the former in this chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">26.1 DESIRED PROPERTIES OF A GOOD GENERATOR</FONT></H3>
<P>In order to understand why one random-number generator would be considered better than another, consider first how such generators operate. The most common method is to use a recursive relation in which the next number in the sequence is a function of the last one or two numbers, that is,
</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD WIDTH="15%" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB></I> = <I>f</I>(<I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</I>-1</SMALL></SUB>, <I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</I>-2</SMALL></SUB>,...)
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT">(26.1)
</TABLE>
<P>One such function is
</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD WIDTH="15%" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TD><I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB></I> = 5<I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</I>-1</SMALL></SUB> &#43; 1 mod 16
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT">(26.2)
</TABLE>
<P>Starting with <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUB> = 5, we obtain <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> as follows:</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD WIDTH="15%" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> = 5(5) &#43; 1 mod 16 = 26 mod 16 = 10
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT">(26.3)
</TABLE>
<P>The first 32 numbers obtained by this procedure are 10, 3, 0, 1, 6, 15, 12, 13, 2, 11, 8, 9, 14, 7, 4, 5 10, 3, 0, 1, 6, 15, 12, 13, 2, 11, 8, 9, 14, 7, 4, 5.
</P>
<P>The <I>x</I>&#146;s are integers between 0 and 15. By dividing <I>x</I>&#146;s by 16, we get a sequence of random numbers between 0 and 1. For this example, the numbers are 0.6250, 0.1875, 0.0000, 0.0625, 0.3750, 0.9375, 0.7500, 0.8125, 0.1250, 0.6875, 0.5000, 0.5625, 0.8750, 0.4375, 0.2500, 0.3125, 0.6250, 0.1875, 0.0000, 0.0625, 0.3750, 0.9375, 0.7500, 0.8125, 0.1250, 0.6875, 0.5000, 0.5625, 0.8750, 0.4375, 0.2500, 0.3125.</P>
<P>It is obvious that if the function <I>f</I> is known, we can regenerate the sequence any time provided the starting value <I>x</I><SUB><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUB> is given. This value, which is used to begin the sequence, is called the <B>seed</B>.</P>
<P>An important observation about this example is that the function <I>f</I> is deterministic. Given the seed, we can tell with a probability of 1 what the numbers in the sequence would be. Yet the numbers are random in the sense that they would pass statistical tests for randomness. These numbers are therefore only partially random and are called <B>pseudo-random</B>. Such numbers are preferable to <I>fully random</I> numbers in simulation applications because it is often desirable to be able to repeat a simulation experiment exactly the way it was done before. Of course, if a different result is needed, we can change the seed before running the simulation. Thus, we have additional control over reproducibility of results.</P>
<P>Notice that in the preceding example, only the first 16 numbers are unique. The 17th number is the same as the first and the remaining sequence is simply a cyclic repetition of the first 16 numbers. In other words, this random-number generator has a <B>cycle length</B> of 16. Some generators do not repeat an initial part of the sequence. This part is called the <B>tail</B>. In such cases, the <B>period</B> of the generator is the sum of the tail length <I>L</I> and the cycle length <I>C</I>, as shown in Figure 26.1.</P>
<P>A performance analyst developing a simulation model has to select an appropriate value for seed and an appropriate generator function. The seed selection is discussed later in Section 26.7. Here, we concentrate on selecting the right generator function.</P>

<P>The desired properties of the generator function are as follows:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>It should be efficiently computable</I>. Since simulations typically require several thousand random numbers in each run, the processor time required to generate these numbers should be small.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The period should be large</I>. A small period may cause the random-number sequence to recycle, resulting in a repeated event sequence. This may limit the useful length of simulation runs.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The successive values should be independent and uniformly distributed</I>. The correlation between successive numbers should be small. Correlation, if significant, indicates dependence.
</DL>
<P>While the first two properties are easy to establish, the third requires a battery of tests, which are discussed later in Chapter 27. Following are some of the types of random-number generators discussed in this chapter:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear-congruential generators
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tausworthe generators
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Fibonacci generators
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined generators
</DL>
<P>A description of each of these approaches follows.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">26.2 LINEAR-CONGRUENTIAL GENERATORS</FONT></H3>
<P>In 1951, D. H. Lehmer discovered that the residues of successive powers of a number have good randomness properties. He obtained the <I>n</I>th number in the sequence by dividing the <I>n</I>th power of an integer <I>a</I> by another integer <I>m</I> and taking the remainder. That is,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB></I> = <I>a<SUP><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUP></I> mod <I>m</I></P>
<P>An equivalent expression used to compute <I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB></I> after computing <I><SUB><SMALL>n</I>-1</SMALL></SUB> is</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</I></SMALL></SUB> = <I>ax<SUB><SMALL>n</I>-1</SMALL></SUB> mod <I>m</I></P>
<P>The parameters <I>a</I> and <I>m</I> are called <B>multiplier</B> and <B>modulus</B>, respectively. Lehmer&#146;s choices for these parameters were <I>a</I> = 23 and <I>m</I> = 10<SUP><SMALL>8</SMALL></SUP> &#43; 1. These choices made it very easy to implement on ENIAC, which was an eight-digit decimal machine.</P>
<P>Many of the currently used random-number generators are a generalization of the Lehmer&#146;s proposal and have the following form:</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD WIDTH="15%" ALIGN="LEFT">
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB></I> = <I>ax<SUB><SMALL>n</I>-1</SMALL></SUB> &#43; <I>b</I> mod <I>m</I>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT">(26.4)
</TABLE>
<P>Here, the <I>x<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB></I>&#146;s are integers between 0 and <I>m</I> - 1. Constants <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> are nonnegative.</P>
<P>These generators are popular because they can be analyzed easily, and certain guarantees can be made about their properties using the theory of congruences. For this reason, they are also called <B>Mixed Linear-Congruential Generators</B> or <B>Linear-Congruential Generators</B> (<B>LCGs</B>) for short. The word <I>mixed</I> implies using both multiplication by <I>a</I> and addition of <I>b</I>.</P>
<P>In general, the choice of <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, and <I>m</I> affects the period and autocorrelation in the sequence. A number of researchers have studied such generators, and the results of their studies can be summarized as follows:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The modulus <I>m</I> should be large. Since all <I>x</I>&#146;s must be between 0 and <I>m</I> - 1, the period can never be more than <I>m</I>.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;For mod <I>m</I> computation to be efficient, <I>m</I> should be a power of 2, that is, 2<I><SUP><SMALL>k</SMALL></SUP></I>. In this case, mod <I>m</I> can be obtained by truncating the result to the right by <I>k</I> bits.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If <I>b</I> is nonzero, the maximum possible period <I>m</I> is obtained if and only if
<DL>
<DD><B>(a)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;integers <I>m</I> and <I>b</I> are relatively prime, that is, have no common factors other than 1;
<DD><B>(b)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;every prime number that is a factor of <I>m</I> is also a factor of <I>a</I> - 1; and
<DD><B>(c)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>a</I> - 1 is a multiple of 4, if integer <I>m</I> is a multiple of 4

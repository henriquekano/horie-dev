Introduction
============
  Motivation:
    - Definition of the problem:
        - What is relational similarity? Compare with attribute similarity.
        - Why is it relevant? Measures how analogous relations are.
    - Applications:
        - Keyword-based search: Retrieve documents that are relevant to the words used, not necessarily to the implied relations.
        - Useful for implicitly stated analogies.
    - Challenges:
        - Similarity is dynamic.
        - Multiple relations between a single pair.
        - More than one way to express a single relation.
  Related work:
    - General problems with previous methods: Heavy load and lack of support for named entities.
    - Give examples explaining very briefly (only important points), and reference their works!

Proposed Method
===============
  Outline: A figure is enough
  Retrieving contexts: Extract semantic relations that pertain in each word pair
    - How? Using text snippets retrieved from search engines.
    - Snippets: Small window of text, method computationally efficient for this matter.
    - Queries: "A * B", etc. Window has a specified length.
    - Remove duplicate search results.
  Extracting lexical patterns:
    - Proposes a shallow lexical pattern extraction algorithm that requires no language-dependent preprocessing.
    - Step 1: Given a context S, replace A and B for variable X and Y.
    - Step 2: Generate all subsequences of the context S.
    - Step 3: Count frequencies of all generated subsequences for all word pairs.
  Identification semantic relations:
    - Distributional hypothesis: Words that occur in the same contexts have similar meanings.
    - Figure for distribution of lexical patterns in word pairs (figure 2).
        - Cluster lexical patterns using the similarity of their distributions over word pairs,
    - Non-sense algebra (read later).
  Measuring relational similarity:
    - More non-sense algebra (read later).

Experiments
===========
  Outline: Classifying semantic relations between named entities (ENT dataset), and solving SAT word-analogy questions (SAT dataset).
  Relation classification:
    - 100 instances (named-entities pairs) of 5 types.
    - Multi-class classification problem.
    - Bla bla bla
  SAT Word-Analogy Questions:
    - Yadda yadda yadda

Conclusion
==========
  What are the contributions of this research?
    - Propose a shallow, lexical-pattern-based approach to represent various semantic relations.
    - Present a clustering algorithm to cluster lexical patterns.
    - Evaluate the proposed method in two tasks.
  Future work
